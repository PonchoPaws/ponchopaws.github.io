I grew up in the new millenium, with the PlayStation as a massive part of my childhood. This was before online gaming really became popular (at least for consoles), and games shipped on-disc in their final state where day-one patches weren't a thing. Nowadays, physical copies of games are represented by a near-empty, souless plastic box containing a lonely disc and _maybe_ a thin piece of paper with some legal gumph. Gone are the days of sitting in the back of the car, excitedly reading a full-colour instruction booklet or poring over a fantastical map, barely being able to wait until you got home to load up the game and get lost in whatever world awaited you. I think the main reason I've held onto my large collection of physical videogame media is nostalgia for this era.

My childhood videogame experiences were almost exclusively console-based, save for a handful of PC titles I would play on the family Windows XP computer. The fondest of these was SimCity 3000 which remains one of my favourite games of all time. The era of the PC big box, from the mid 80s to early 2000s, is perhaps the most iconic embodiment of the physical videogame media I have such an affinity for. These big box games often came packed with extensive manuals, maps and other physical extras that did so much to enhance the experience, such as additional lore or background information to help immerse you in the game world. There is a unique charm there that has been lost with the move to digital downloads.

I recently read a [blog post by Mike Jolley](https://mikejolley.com/2023/05/12/building-a-windows-98-retro-gaming-pc-on-the-athlon-xp-platform/) who built a retro gaming PC in 2023 to reacquaint himself with his favourite DOS titled of yesteryear. I'm also a regular watcher of [LGR](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.youtube.com/%40LGR&ved=2ahUKEwjo2MeE9ISLAxVNSEEAHWL4MNUQjjh6BAgJEAE&usg=AOvVaw24ia0Tdz0xKdRW3uDixe0c)'s channel on YouTube, who is a popular reviewer of retro tech, especially PCs. Both of these things inspired me to have a crack at building my own retro Windows 98 gaming PC.
