&lt;p&gt;In July last year, my wife and I travelled to Japan on our three week honeymoon. Prior to the holiday I considered purchasing a mirrorless camera so that I could take better photos than my Samsung S23 smartphone could capture. Ultimately, I decided against the purchase as I wanted to pack lightly due to the number of different destinations we&amp;rsquo;d be moving between. I still managed to take some fantastic photos of Japan, but the thought of a proper camera didn&amp;rsquo;t escape my mind and I ended up purchasing a mirrorless body and a couple of lenses in October.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
